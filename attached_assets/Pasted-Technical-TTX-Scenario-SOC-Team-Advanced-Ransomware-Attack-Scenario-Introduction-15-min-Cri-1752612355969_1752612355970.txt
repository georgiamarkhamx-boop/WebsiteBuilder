Scenario Review & Maturity Recommendations (30 min):
	•	Comprehensive discussion on optimal choices, preventive measures, internal security practices, IR improvements, and maturity model advancement.

Strategic TTX Scenario (C-Suite & Board): Third-Party Malware Incident
Scenario Introduction (15 min):
	•	Third-party vendor software update introduces stealthy malware, silently exfiltrating sensitive customer data over several weeks.
Decision Pathway (75 min):
Step 1: Crisis Team Activation (15 min)
	•	Immediate Gold Team Activation: Coordinated response, but creates media speculation.
	•	Delayed Activation: Malware exfiltration intensifies, compromising significantly more data.
Scenario Twist:
	•	News leak occurs through external security researchers, prompting sudden media attention.
Step 2: Communication Strategy (20 min)
	•	Proactive Public Statement: Controls narrative but prompts immediate regulator inquiry.
	•	Reactive Communication: Increased negative perception, media backlash, and regulatory fines risk.
Scenario Twist:
	•	GDPR regulator initiates immediate investigation, highlighting legal exposure.
Step 3: Regulatory & Legal Handling (20 min)
	•	Full Cooperation with Regulators Immediately: Regulatory leniency but exposes organizational weaknesses publicly.
	•	Limited Cooperation: Short-term protection but risks heavy fines and severe sanctions.
Scenario Twist:
	•	Major customers threaten litigation over breached contracts.
Step 4: Operational Continuity & Vendor Management (20 min)
	•	Immediate Transition to Alternative Vendors: Significant short-term disruption, mitigates long-term risks.
	•	Staying with Current Vendor Temporarily: Operational stability in short term, but risk of additional compromise.
Scenario Review & Maturity Recommendations (30 min):
	•	Evaluate decision outcomes, discuss strategic crisis management best practices, regulatory alignment, vendor management, and enhance organizational maturity.

Professional-Level TTX Scenario: Zero-Day Exploit Leading to Network Outage
Scenario Introduction (15 min):
	•	Zero-day vulnerability discovered and exploited on critical networking infrastructure, rapidly escalating to total network outage affecting global operations.
Decision Pathway (75 min):
Step 1: Initial Response (15 min)
	•	Immediate Segmentation and Containment: Limits immediate impact but leaves teams disconnected, impairing incident response.
	•	Prioritized Investigation: Attack propagates rapidly, disabling additional critical systems.
Scenario Twist:
	•	Communications platforms internally impacted, teams struggle with internal coordination.
Step 2: Communication Strategy (20 min)
	•	Activate Alternate Communication Channels Immediately: Ensures critical communications, but unfamiliarity causes confusion.
	•	Delayed Activation of Alternate Comms: Internal communication blackout, exacerbating operational paralysis.
Scenario Twist:
	•	Zero-day exploit leaked publicly, attracting external scrutiny and potential exploitation by additional threat actors.
Step 3: Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (20 min)
	•	Immediate DR Activation: Quickly restores core operations but reveals untested DR processes.
	•	Delayed DR Activation: Thorough preparation, but results in extended operational downtime and significant revenue loss.
Scenario Twist:
	•	Additional undetected vulnerabilities identified during DR activation.
Step 4: Post-Incident Reporting & Analysis (20 min)
	•	Detailed and Transparent Incident Analysis: Facilitates trust restoration, highlights procedural weaknesses.
	•	Restricted Incident Report: Protects internal reputation short-term but results in unresolved vulnerabilities and future risks.
Scenario Review & Maturity Recommendations (30 min):
	•	Detailed analysis of decisions, business continuity strategies, crisis communication effectiveness, vulnerability management, and BCM & DR maturity improvement recommendations.



Detailed TTX Scenario 1: Insider Threat Incident
Scenario Introduction (15 min):
Present initial scenario:
	•	A senior employee flagged by automated detection systems for suspicious data access and potential data exfiltration.
	•	Highlight sensitive data types involved (client information, financial records, intellectual property).
	•	Discuss potential impacts and critical immediate considerations.
Decision Pathway (75 min):
Step 1: Immediate Action (20 min)
	•	Option A (Immediate Suspension):
	•	Present potential consequences: retaliation, data exposure.
	•	Key considerations: employee rights, evidence sufficiency.
	•	Option B (Covert Monitoring):
	•	Potential benefits: additional evidence, clearer intent identification.
	•	Risks: increased data leakage during monitoring.
Scenario twist: Insider escalates actions by attempting access to additional systems and exfiltrating further sensitive data.
Step 2: Investigation Strategy (20 min)
	•	Option A (Engage HR/Legal Immediately):
	•	Ensure procedural correctness, potential prevention of legal backlash.
	•	Risk prolonged investigation, further internal tension.
	•	Option B (Internal Security Team Only):
	•	Faster response, immediate containment.
	•	Risk mishandling evidence, procedural mistakes.
Scenario twist: Insider employs external channels to anonymously threaten public exposure unless demands are met.
Step 3: External Communication Strategy (20 min)
	•	Option A (Proactive Public Disclosure):
	•	Transparency, trust retention.
	•	Immediate reputational risks, potential panic.
	•	Option B (Confidential Handling Initially):
