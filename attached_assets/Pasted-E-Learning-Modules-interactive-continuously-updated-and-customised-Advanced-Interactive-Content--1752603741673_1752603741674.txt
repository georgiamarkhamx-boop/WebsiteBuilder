🔍 10 Specific, Underserved Gaps in the Cybersecurity Training Market
⸻
1. 🧠 Cybersecurity for Non-Tech Board Members
Gap: Most exec training is bland, one-off, or death-by-PowerPoint.
Pain: Boards fear making the wrong call during a breach, but don’t know how to act.
Opportunity: Strategic-level TTX with branching outcomes, comms crisis handling, reputational risk scoring, and law/reg guidance.
✅ Nobody’s doing this well.
✅ You can charge £3K–£10K per boardroom simulation, or a license to consultancies.

⸻
2. 🔄 Dynamic Compliance Coach
Gap: Platforms like KnowBe4 tell users what the rules are. But what if they change jurisdictions, cert goals, or compliance schemes?
Pain: Companies don’t know what to do next for compliance.
Opportunity: Let them choose their frameworks (e.g. NIST, ISO, Cyber Essentials) and give real-time, personalised training & maturity feedback.
✅ Use conditional logic + scoring — very doable with no-code tools
✅ SMEs and MSPs will pay monthly for this, especially in regulated industries.

⸻
3. 🛠️ Zero-to-One Security Maturity Builder (For Non-Cyber Orgs)
Gap: Most platforms assume orgs have a security baseline. What about charities, schools, startups, or local gov?
Pain: These orgs have nothing, no policies, and no idea where to begin.
Opportunity: A module that builds maturity from scratch, explains controls in plain language, and links to real templates/checklists.
✅ Simple monthly pricing works here
✅ Package it as “Cyber-in-a-Box for Orgs with No IT Teams”

⸻
4. 🧑‍🏫 Sector-Specific Role-Based Training
Gap: Platforms treat users like generic employees
Pain: HR teams don’t care about OT threats. OT staff don’t care about HR phishing
Opportunity: Create industry packs or job-specific modules:
	•	“Cyber for School Admins”
	•	“Cyber for Remote Builders”
	•	“Cyber for Charity Trustees”
✅ Each one builds your value in niche sectors
✅ Easier to sell B2B in verticals like healthcare, education, non-profits

⸻
5. 🧩 Interactive Policy Builder + Scenario Tester
Gap: Companies download policies from templates, never test them
Pain: Policies exist for auditors, not for real response
Opportunity: Upload or build a policy → simulate a scenario → see where the policy fails → update live
✅ This is real maturity, not just training
✅ Could be a bolt-on to your TTX service

⸻
6. 🔐 Privacy & Data Protection for Employees — With Local Laws
Gap: GDPR awareness is everywhere, but very few platforms customize by country
Pain: International teams don’t know which laws apply, or what their obligations are
Opportunity: Ask the user where they operate → show DP content for that region only (GDPR, CCPA, PDPA, etc.)
✅ You already planned this — lean into it harder
✅ Multinational companies struggle here, even with big platforms

⸻
7. 📉 Cyber Insurance Readiness Simulator
Gap: Most orgs apply blind for cyber insurance
Pain: They get rejected or charged massive premiums
Opportunity: A step-by-step maturity assessment tool that simulates an insurer’s review, tells them what to fix, and trains them on what would happen during a claim.
✅ Could partner with insurance brokers or MSPs
✅ Price as a premium module (great for B2B)

⸻
8. 🤯 Post-Incident Leadership Training
Gap: Most TTX platforms stop after “the breach happens”
Pain: Execs don’t know what to say, report, or decide next
Opportunity: Branching TTX that covers:
	•	Who to notify?
	•	Do we pay the ransom?
	•	Do we report to the ICO/SEC?
	•	What if the comms team says, “don’t tell anyone”?
✅ Nobody is doing this well — you could own this corner

⸻
9. 📱 Secure Remote Workforce Microtraining
Gap: Tons of remote workers now = tons of risk
Pain: VPN misconfigurations, home Wi-Fi, cloud abuse
Opportunity: 5-minute simulations for:
	•	Using personal devices
	•	Shadow IT
	•	Sharing in Google Drive/Teams
✅ Can be embedded into Slack, Teams, or intranets
✅ Works beautifully as a monthly micro-SaaS

⸻
10. 🔁 360° Human Risk Platform
Gap: Everyone focuses on phishing, not decision failure
Pain: Humans don’t click phish… they make bad calls under pressure
Opportunity: Build around:
	•	Decision simulations
	•	Human maturity scoring
	•	Policy testers
	•	Live heatmaps showing weak departments
✅ A full maturity platform.
✅ The one you’re already half-building — just position it that way.
