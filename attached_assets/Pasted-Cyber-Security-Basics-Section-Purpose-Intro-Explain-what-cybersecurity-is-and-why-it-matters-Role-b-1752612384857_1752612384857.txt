🔀 Step-by-Step Flow with Customization Logic
1. Welcome & Personalization Setup
Ask the user:


✅ “What country are you in?” → Changes legal/regulatory parts


✅ “Which compliance standard applies to your company?”


Options: Cyber Essentials / NIST / ISO 27001 / None


✅ “What’s your role?” → Show examples relevant to their job:


Employee / Manager / IT / HR / C-Suite


Use these answers to set branching logic for later.

2. What is Cybersecurity? (Core Content)
Simple explanation: “Cybersecurity is how we protect computers, data, and systems from being attacked.”


Include:


What’s a threat?


What’s a vulnerability?


What is risk?


Interactive Tip: Add a drag-and-drop or fill-in-the-blank for the definitions.

3. Common Threats
Based on their role, change the examples:


Employee: phishing, unsafe websites, USB malware


IT: misconfigurations, patching, insider threat


C-Suite: ransomware, reputation damage, CEO fraud


Threats to cover:
Phishing (show 2 examples – one obvious, one subtle)


Malware (ransomware, trojans, etc.)


Social engineering


Weak passwords


Shadow IT (unauthorized apps/devices)


Interactive: “Which of these is a safe email to click?” → multiple-choice.

4. Cyber Hygiene (Best Practices)
Use role-based examples:


Strong password tips


Why updates matter


Locking your screen


Not using personal email/apps for work


Turning on MFA (maybe link to your MFA guide)


Scenario Game: Choose a good or bad action and see the result (e.g. “I reused my password” → got hacked).

5. Compliance Module (Auto-switch based on selection)
Cyber Essentials


Covers: Firewalls, secure settings, access control, malware protection, patch management.


Short quiz: “Which control helps prevent ransomware?”


NIST


Use NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)


Ask: “Which function helps detect a threat quickly?”


ISO 27001


Covers risk management, policies, and controls.


Ask: “What’s the purpose of an ISMS?”


If they choose “None” → give simplified best-practice version.

6. Legal/Regulation (Auto-switch by Country)
UK → GDPR, Cyber Essentials, ICO contact


USA → CCPA, HIPAA (optional), NIST


EU → GDPR, ENISA


Canada → PIPEDA


APAC → APRA, PDPA, etc.


Scenario: “Your company suffers a data breach. What do you do?” → route based on correct law.

7. Final Quiz + Feedback
Mix role-based questions and scenario questions.


Include instant feedback:


“Correct – you stopped a phishing attack!”


“Not quite – in ISO 27001, you would report this to your ISMS manager.”
